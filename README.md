## 6. Next Steps
This is a very simple employee manager and could benefit from the following updates
- Added functionality to the 'go back' selections.
- The ability to *stop* recursively adding managers.
- Improved UI.
- Improved logs so that the user is more more sure of what it is they are updating.
